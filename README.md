What is Redux?  It helps to understand what this "Redux" thing is in the first place. What does it do? What problems does it help me solve? Why would I want to use it? Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.  Single source of trut The global state of your application is stored in an object tree within a single store. State is read-only The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what  happened. Changes are made with pure functions To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
